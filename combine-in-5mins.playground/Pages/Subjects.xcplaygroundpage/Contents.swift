//: Our Pass Through Subject publisher is simply passing our value through the data stream to each subscriber. It doesn't get much simpler than that!
//:
//: - Experiment:
//:  The `PassthroughSubject` publishes values as they change. However, the `CurrentValueSubject` publisher informs each new subscriber of the current value first, followed by new events. Change the publisher to a `CurrentValueSubject` and re-run the code. Do you see the current value printed in the console first?
